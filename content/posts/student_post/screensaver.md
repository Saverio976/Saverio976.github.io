First year, first graphical project.

Goal: With only pixels, using the C language and
[CSFML](https://github.com/SFML/csfml), draw annimated forms on the screen.

---

We could not use image. Only pixels... But what is a `.bmp` file ?

A header, with the width and height. And a list of each pixel with its R G B.
No compression.

So why not just draw each pixel ?
