For the 4th year of EPITECH school, we need to study one year abroad at a partner university.

The process to select our university is simple: We select 8 choice and rank them by order of preference.
Then, the school ranks the student with a formula that mix our grades, our scores in english, and our participation (open days, association, ...).

My top 3 were: 1:Halmstad University (Sweden), 2:Roskilde University (Denmark), 3:Heriot Watt University (United Kingdom).

The availability for Halmstad was 5 places, 2 for Roskilde, and 10 for Heriot Watt. Unfortunately, students with highter grades and participation selected my 2 first choices.

My third choice was Heriot Watt because of one sport club in particuliar: Archery. And also, I will get a diploma at the end of the 4th year.

What I didn't expect was to have to do produce a research project (master thesis), and that it will take me all the summer (3 semesters yes).

Anyway, Heriot Watt University is nice! Scotland is amazing.
